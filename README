# Learn-C-the-Hard-Way 
# By Zed Shaw

The code from the book Learn C the Hard way. I wrote this while going through the book. 
This is just proof that I read it and documentation for me to look at later if I need it.

Some of the code may have been edited to include more comments and Zed's extra credit sections.
